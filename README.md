### [Acton](https://www.acton-lang.org)
Acton is a general purpose programming language, designed to be useful for a wide range of applications, from desktop applications to embedded and distributed systems. In a first approximation Acton can be described as a seamless addition of a powerful new construct to an existing language: Acton adds actors to Python.

Acton is a compiled language, offering the speed of C but with a considerably simpler programming model. There is no explicit memory management, instead relying on garbage collection.

Acton is statically typed with an expressive type language and type inference. Type inferrence means you don't have to explicitly declare types of every variable but that the compiler will infer the type and performs its checks accordingly. We can have the benefits of type safety without the extra overhead involved in declaring types.

The Acton Run Time System (RTS) offers a distributed mode of operation allowing multiple computers to participate in running one logical Acton system. Actors can migrate between compute nodes for load sharing purposes and similar. The RTS offers exactly once delivery guarantees. Through checkpointing of actor states to a distributed database, the failure of individual compute nodes can be recovered by restoring actor state. Your system can run forever!

### [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/Main/HomePage)
Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language. It has inductive families, i.e., data types which depend on values, such as the type of vectors of a given length. It also has parametrised modules, mixfix operators, Unicode characters, and an interactive Emacs interface which can assist the programmer in writing the program.

Agda is a proof assistant. It is an interactive system for writing and checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory, a foundational system for constructive mathematics developed by the Swedish logician Per Martin-L√∂f. It has many similarities with other proof assistants based on dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram, Matita and NuPRL.

Agda is open-source and enjoys contributions from many authors. The center of the Agda development is the Programming Logic group at Chalmers and Gothenburg University. The main developers are Ulf Norell, Nils Anders Danielsson, Jesper Cockx, and Andreas Abel.

### [AnalLang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/AnalLang)
AnalLang is a language that takes a Node.js program to translate to AnalLang by splitting each character, translating each character to its ASCII code, and repeating the "üçëüçÜ" emoji sequence by the ASCII code, then adding a space and taking the next letter from the string and translating to the "üçëüçÜ" emoji sequence, which is repeated until all letters are translated.

AnalLang interprets by splitting each "üçëüçÜ" emoji sequence, then splitting all the spaces into an array, then looping through each entry and counting appearances of "üçëüçÜ", which is then turned into an ASCII code and then into its original character, then looping until all characters have been translated to their original form, then joining the characters and evaluating the final result.

### [Beef](https://www.beeflang.org)
Beef is an open source performance-oriented compiled programming language which has been built hand-in-hand with its IDE environment. The syntax and many semantics are most directly derived from C#, while attempting to retain the C ideals of bare-metal explicitness and lack of runtime surprises, with some "modern" niceties inspired by languages such as Rust, Swift, and Go.

Beef's primary design goal is to provide a fluid and pleasurable development experience for high-performance real-time applications such as video games, with low-level features that make it suitable for engine development, combined with high-level ergonomics suitable for game code development.

Beef allows for safely mixing different optimization levels on a per-type or per-method level, allowing for performance-critical code to be executed at maximum speed without affecting debuggability of the rest of the application.

Memory management in Beef is manual, and includes first-class support for custom allocators. Care has been taken to reduce the burden of manual memory management with language ergonomics and runtime safeties ‚Äì Beef can detect memory leaks in real-time, and offers guaranteed protection against use-after-free and double-deletion errors. As with most safety features in Beef, these memory safeties can be turned off in release builds for maximum performance.

The Beef IDE supports productivity features such as autocomplete, fixits, reformatting, refactoring tools, type inspection, runtime code compilation (hot code swapping), and a built-in profiler. The IDE's general-purpose debugger is capable of debugging native applications written in any language, and is intended to be a fully-featured standalone debugger even for pure C/C++ developers who want an alternative to Visual Studio debugging.

Curv is a programming language for creating art using mathematics. It's a 2D and 3D geometric modelling tool that supports full colour, animation and 3D printing.
Features:
* Curv is a simple, powerful, dynamically typed, pure functional programming language.
* Curv is easy to use for beginners. It has a standard library of predefined geometric shapes, plus operators for transforming and combining shapes. These can be plugged together like Lego to make 2D and 3D models.
* Coloured shapes are represented using Function Representation (F-Rep). They can be infinitely detailed, infinitely large, and any shape or colour pattern that can be described using mathematics can be represented exactly.
* Curv exposes the full power of F-Rep programming to experts. The standard geometry library is written entirely in Curv. Many of the demos seen on shadertoy.com can be reproduced in Curv, using shorter, simpler programs. Experts can package techniques used on shadertoy as high level operations for use by beginners.
* Rendering is GPU accelerated. Curv programs are compiled into fragment shaders which are executed on the GPU.
* Curv can export meshes to STL, OBJ and X3D files for 3D printing. The X3D format supports full colour 3D printing (on Shapeways.com, at least). These meshes are defect free: watertight, manifold, with no self intersections, degenerate triangles, or flipped triangles.

### [DaCe](https://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/Research/DAPP)
Decoupling domain science from performance optimization.

DaCe is a fast parallel programming framework that takes code in Python/NumPy and other programming languages, and maps it to high-performance CPU, GPU, and FPGA programs, which can be optimized to achieve state-of-the-art. Internally, DaCe uses the Stateful DataFlow multiGraph (SDFG) data-centric intermediate representation: A transformable, interactive representation of code based on data movement. Since the input code and the SDFG are separate, it is possible to optimize a program without changing its source, so that it stays readable. On the other hand, transformations are customizable and user-extensible, so they can be written once and reused in many applications. With data-centric parallel programming, we enable direct knowledge transfer of performance optimization, regardless of the application or the target processor.

DaCe generates high-performance programs for:
* Multi-core CPUs (tested on Intel, IBM POWER9, and ARM with SVE)
* NVIDIA GPUs and AMD GPUs (with HIP)
* Xilinx and Intel FPGAs

### [daScript](https://dascript.org)
daScript is a high-level programming language that features strong static typing. It is designed to provide high performance and serves as an embeddable 'scripting' language for C++ applications that require fast and reliable performance, such as games or back end/servers. Additionally, it functions effectively as a standalone programming language.

daScript is:
* Extremely fast programming language that can rival compiled or JIT languages even in interpreter mode. It consistently outperforms dynamically interpreted scripting languages such as Lua. When used in AOT mode, daScript is often faster than naively written C++ due to its SSE-friendly POD-types, and it even surpasses some of the best JIT VMs like V8 or LuaJIT. As a result, there's no need to rewrite your daScript code in C++ to optimize your application.
* Safe and versatile programming language that provides all the benefits of static typing. Many errors that would break an application in runtime in languages like Lua or JavaScript won't even compile in daScript. Additionally, due to its support for generics, type inference, and macros, daScript is easy and fluid to use. Safety is a fundamental pillar of daScript's design, making it safer in many cases than languages like C++ or Java.
* Real embedded programming language that requires no external dependencies other than a C++17 compiler. Its interop capabilities are both super easy to use and safe, as is expected from any embedded scripting language that's meant to call native code.

### [Eberban](https://eberban.github.io/eberban)
Eberban is a logical constructed language aimed to satisfy the following goals :
* **being simple**: the Eberban grammar allows manipulating predicates with particles in a way that is close to the higher-order logic it translates into, while abstracting away the verbosity of explicitly providing variables as arguments of predicates.
* **being regular**: valid sentences are syntactically unambiguous. Most grammar rules rely on particles which are organised into families, each starting with a unique prefix. Many additional patterns are shared between particles and predicate words to help with learning groups of related words.
* **being expressive**: the grammar and core vocabulary focus on providing a simple framework, on top of which can be built abstractions, complex concepts and tools. Since those are built into Eberban itself, users can create their own tools and abstractions to express entirely new concepts.
Eberban takes inspiration from Lojban and other logical languages, but tries novel approaches to satisfy the above goals.

### [Hylo](https://www.hylo-lang.org)
Hylo (formely Val) is a programming language that leverages mutable value semantics and generic programming for high-level systems programming.
* **Fast by definition**: Hylo is compiled ahead-of-time to machine code and relies on its type system to support in-place mutation and avoid unnecessary memory allocations. Hylo avoids hidden costs such as implicit copies and therefore avoids heavy dependence on an optimizer for basic performance.
* **Safe by default**: Hylo‚Äôs foundation of mutable value semantics ensures that ordinary code is memory safe, typesafe, and data-race-free. By explicit, auditable opt-in, programmers can use unsafe constructs for performance where necessary, and can build safe constructs using unsafe ones.
* **Simple**: Hylo borrows heavily from Swift which has demonstrated a user-friendly approach to generic programming and deep support for value semantics. Hylo‚Äôs programming model strengthens and extends this support, while de-emphasizing reference semantics and avoiding the complexities that result from trying to make it statically safe (e.g., memory regions, lifetime annotations, etc.).

### [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org)
Idris is a programming language designed to encourage Type-Driven Development.

In Idris, types are first-class constructs in the langauge. This means types can be passed as arguments to functions, and returned from functions just like any other value, such as numbers, strings, or lists. This is a small but powerful idea, enabling:
* relationships to be expressed between values; for example, that two lists have the same length.
* assumptions to be made explicit and checked by the compiler. For example, if you assume that a list is non-empty, Idris can ensure this assumption always holds before the program is run.
* if desired, properties of program behaviour to be formally stated and proven.

### [Jasmin](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin)
Jasmin is a workbench for high-assurance and high-speed cryptography. Jasmin implementations aim at being efficient, safe, correct, and secure.

The Jasmin programming language smoothly combines high-level and low-level constructs, so as to support ‚Äúassembly in the head‚Äù programming. Programmers can control many low-level details that are performance-critical: instruction selection and scheduling, what registers to spill and when, etc. They can also rely on high-level abstractions (variables, functions, arrays, loops, etc.) to structure their code and make it more amenable to formal verification.

The semantics is formally defined to allow rigorous reasoning about program behaviors. The Coq definitions can be found in the proofs/lang/sem.v file. This semantics is executable, thus Jasmin programs can be directly interpreted.

Jasmin programs can be automatically checked for safety and termination (using a trusted static analyzer).

The Jasmin compiler produces predictable assembly and ensures that the use of high-level abstractions incurs no run-time penalty. It is formally verified for correctness (the precise Coq statement and the corresponding machine-checked proofs can be found in the proofs/compiler/compiler_proof.v file). This justifies that many properties can be proved on a source program and still apply to the corresponding assembly program: safety, termination, functional correctness‚Ä¶

The Jasmin workbench leverages the EasyCrypt toolset for formal verification. Jasmin programs can be extracted to corresponding EasyCrypt programs to prove functional correctness, cryptographic security, or security against side-channel attacks (constant-time).

### [LinguaFranca](https://www.lf-lang.org)
Lingua Franca (LF) is a polyglot coordination language for concurrent and possibly time-sensitive applications ranging from low-level embedded code to distributed cloud and edge applications. An LF program specifies the interactions between components called reactors. The emphasis of the framework is on ensuring deterministic interaction with explicit management of timing. The logic of each reactor is written in one of a suite of target languages (currently C, C++, Python, and TypeScript) and can integrate legacy code in those languages. A code generator synthesizes one or more programs in the target language, which are then compiled using standard toolchains. If the application has exploitable parallelism, then it executes transparently on multiple cores without compromising determinacy. A distributed application translates into multiple programs and scripts to launch those programs on distributed machines. The communication fabric connecting components is synthesized as part of the programs.

### [Mun](https://mun-lang.org)
Mun is a programming language empowering creation through iteration.
* **Ahead of time compilation** - Mun is compiled ahead of time (AOT), as opposed to being interpreted or compiled just in time (JIT). By detecting errors in the code during AOT compilation, an entire class of runtime errors is eliminated. This allows developers to stay within the comfort of their IDE instead of having to switch between the IDE and target application to debug runtime errors.
* **Statically typed** - Mun resolves types at compilation time instead of at runtime, resulting in immediate feedback when writing code and opening the door for powerful refactoring tools.
* **First class hot-reloading** - Every aspect of Mun is designed with hot reloading in mind. Hot reloading is the process of changing code and resources of a live application, removing the need to start, stop and recompile an application whenever a function or value is changed.
* **Performance** - AOT compilation combined with static typing ensure that Mun is compiled to machine code that can be natively executed on any target platform. LLVM is used for compilation and optimization, guaranteeing the best possible performance. Hot reloading does introduce a slight runtime overhead, but it can be disabled for production builds to ensure the best possible runtime performance.
* **Cross compilation** - The Mun compiler is able to compile to all supported target platforms from any supported compiler platform.
* **Powerful IDE integration** - The Mun language and compiler framework are designed to support source code queries, allowing for powerful IDE integrations such as code completion and refactoring tools.

### [Oak](https://github.com/jorbDehmel/oak)
Oak is a modern, compiled, low-level, statically-typed programming language. It uses Rust-like typing, without Rust's lifetimes system. It is analogous to C++ with stronger macro support, modern typing, compile-time syntax modification and integrated package management. It's like if C let you shape the language to your liking. It is named Oak because nature imagery is desperately needed in the mind of a programmer.

Oak is, as of now, a translated language; Oak code is translated via the acorn command (see later) into C++. acorn can also compile Oak into object code, or link it to create executables.

Oak has modifiable syntax (see the section on preprocessor rules), making it highly customizable and flexible in a way that no other mainstream languages are. It supports the creation of "dialects", which are Oak variants which use preprocessor rules to support independent syntactical structures. In this way, Oak provides a strong central core to many branches.

### [Ohm](https://github.com/ohmjs/ohm)
Ohm is a parsing toolkit consisting of a library and a domain-specific language. You can use it to parse custom file formats or quickly build parsers, interpreters, and compilers for programming languages.

The Ohm language is based on parsing expression grammars (PEGs), which are a formal way of describing syntax, similar to regular expressions and context-free grammars. The Ohm library provides a JavaScript interface for creating parsers, interpreters, and more from the grammars you write.
* Full support for left-recursive rules means that you can define left-associative operators in a natural way.
* Object-oriented grammar extension makes it easy to extend an existing language with new syntax.
* Modular semantic actions. Unlike many similar tools, Ohm completely separates grammars from semantic actions. This separation improves modularity and extensibility, and makes both grammars and semantic actions easier to read and understand.
* Online editor and visualizer. The Ohm Editor provides instant feedback and an interactive visualization that makes the entire execution of the parser visible and tangible. It'll make you feel like you have superpowers. üí™

* **Named and optional arguments**: Very useful, my_func(arg0: 5).
* **Not NULL values by default**: This is only possible with option types (?T) and none.
* **Easy error handling**: With result types, func my_func() !T { ... } and catch.
* **A basic preprocessor**: if, else_if, else and endif for optional code using flags (-D my_flag).
* **Immutable values**: Variables and fields are immutable by default.
* **Polymorphism**: Traits and Embedded Structs are supported.
* **Generics**: Specialize and reuse the same code for different types (coming soon).

### [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org)
Roc's goal is to be a fast, friendly, functional language. It's very much a work in progress; below, you can see the current progress towards this goal. This website is intentionally unstyled as a way to emphasize the language's current level of incompleteness. The website will become more polished after the language itself becomes more polished!

Roc compiles to machine code or to WebAssembly. Eventually you'll be able to use Roc to build high-quality servers, command-line applications, graphical native desktop user interfaces, among other classes of applications. Today, only command-line interfaces have support beyond the proof-of-concept stage; the other use cases will mature over time.

Like Lua, Roc's automatic memory management doesn't require a virtual machine, and it's possible to call Roc functions directly from any language that can call C functions. This makes Roc additionally useful as a language for implementing plugins, and gives you a way to incrementally transition a legacy code base from another language to Roc.
