## Programming Languages
### [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/Main/HomePage)
Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language. It has inductive families, i.e., data types which depend on values, such as the type of vectors of a given length. It also has parametrised modules, mixfix operators, Unicode characters, and an interactive Emacs interface which can assist the programmer in writing the program.

Agda is a proof assistant. It is an interactive system for writing and checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory, a foundational system for constructive mathematics developed by the Swedish logician Per Martin-Löf. It has many similarities with other proof assistants based on dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram, Matita and NuPRL.

Agda is open-source and enjoys contributions from many authors. The center of the Agda development is the Programming Logic group at Chalmers and Gothenburg University. The main developers are Ulf Norell, Nils Anders Danielsson, Jesper Cockx, and Andreas Abel.

### [Beef](https://www.beeflang.org)
Beef is an open source performance-oriented compiled programming language which has been built hand-in-hand with its IDE environment. The syntax and many semantics are most directly derived from C#, while attempting to retain the C ideals of bare-metal explicitness and lack of runtime surprises, with some "modern" niceties inspired by languages such as Rust, Swift, and Go.

Beef's primary design goal is to provide a fluid and pleasurable development experience for high-performance real-time applications such as video games, with low-level features that make it suitable for engine development, combined with high-level ergonomics suitable for game code development.

Beef allows for safely mixing different optimization levels on a per-type or per-method level, allowing for performance-critical code to be executed at maximum speed without affecting debuggability of the rest of the application.

Memory management in Beef is manual, and includes first-class support for custom allocators. Care has been taken to reduce the burden of manual memory management with language ergonomics and runtime safeties – Beef can detect memory leaks in real-time, and offers guaranteed protection against use-after-free and double-deletion errors. As with most safety features in Beef, these memory safeties can be turned off in release builds for maximum performance.

The Beef IDE supports productivity features such as autocomplete, fixits, reformatting, refactoring tools, type inspection, runtime code compilation (hot code swapping), and a built-in profiler. The IDE's general-purpose debugger is capable of debugging native applications written in any language, and is intended to be a fully-featured standalone debugger even for pure C/C++ developers who want an alternative to Visual Studio debugging.

### [Clojure](https://www.clojure.org)
Clojure is a robust, practical, and fast programming language with a set of useful features that together form a simple, coherent, and powerful tool.

Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic – every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.

Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.

### [Hylo](https://www.hylo-lang.org)
Hylo (formely Val) is a programming language that leverages mutable value semantics and generic programming for high-level systems programming.
* **Fast by definition**: Hylo is compiled ahead-of-time to machine code and relies on its type system to support in-place mutation and avoid unnecessary memory allocations. Hylo avoids hidden costs such as implicit copies and therefore avoids heavy dependence on an optimizer for basic performance.
* **Safe by default**: Hylo’s foundation of mutable value semantics ensures that ordinary code is memory safe, typesafe, and data-race-free. By explicit, auditable opt-in, programmers can use unsafe constructs for performance where necessary, and can build safe constructs using unsafe ones.
* **Simple**: Hylo borrows heavily from Swift which has demonstrated a user-friendly approach to generic programming and deep support for value semantics. Hylo’s programming model strengthens and extends this support, while de-emphasizing reference semantics and avoiding the complexities that result from trying to make it statically safe (e.g., memory regions, lifetime annotations, etc.).

### [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org)
Idris is a programming language designed to encourage Type-Driven Development.

In Idris, types are first-class constructs in the langauge. This means types can be passed as arguments to functions, and returned from functions just like any other value, such as numbers, strings, or lists. This is a small but powerful idea, enabling:
* relationships to be expressed between values; for example, that two lists have the same length.
* assumptions to be made explicit and checked by the compiler. For example, if you assume that a list is non-empty, Idris can ensure this assumption always holds before the program is run.
* if desired, properties of program behaviour to be formally stated and proven.

### [LinguaFranca](https://www.lf-lang.org)
Lingua Franca (LF) is a polyglot coordination language for concurrent and possibly time-sensitive applications ranging from low-level embedded code to distributed cloud and edge applications. An LF program specifies the interactions between components called reactors. The emphasis of the framework is on ensuring deterministic interaction with explicit management of timing. The logic of each reactor is written in one of a suite of target languages (currently C, C++, Python, and TypeScript) and can integrate legacy code in those languages. A code generator synthesizes one or more programs in the target language, which are then compiled using standard toolchains. If the application has exploitable parallelism, then it executes transparently on multiple cores without compromising determinacy. A distributed application translates into multiple programs and scripts to launch those programs on distributed machines. The communication fabric connecting components is synthesized as part of the programs.

### [Mun](https://mun-lang.org)
Mun is a programming language empowering creation through iteration.
* **Ahead of time compilation** - Mun is compiled ahead of time (AOT), as opposed to being interpreted or compiled just in time (JIT). By detecting errors in the code during AOT compilation, an entire class of runtime errors is eliminated. This allows developers to stay within the comfort of their IDE instead of having to switch between the IDE and target application to debug runtime errors.
* **Statically typed** - Mun resolves types at compilation time instead of at runtime, resulting in immediate feedback when writing code and opening the door for powerful refactoring tools.
* **First class hot-reloading** - Every aspect of Mun is designed with hot reloading in mind. Hot reloading is the process of changing code and resources of a live application, removing the need to start, stop and recompile an application whenever a function or value is changed.
* **Performance** - AOT compilation combined with static typing ensure that Mun is compiled to machine code that can be natively executed on any target platform. LLVM is used for compilation and optimization, guaranteeing the best possible performance. Hot reloading does introduce a slight runtime overhead, but it can be disabled for production builds to ensure the best possible runtime performance.
* **Cross compilation** - The Mun compiler is able to compile to all supported target platforms from any supported compiler platform.
* **Powerful IDE integration** - The Mun language and compiler framework are designed to support source code queries, allowing for powerful IDE integrations such as code completion and refactoring tools.

### [Roc](https://www.roc-lang.org)
Roc's goal is to be a fast, friendly, functional language. It's very much a work in progress; below, you can see the current progress towards this goal. This website is intentionally unstyled as a way to emphasize the language's current level of incompleteness. The website will become more polished after the language itself becomes more polished!

Roc compiles to machine code or to WebAssembly. Eventually you'll be able to use Roc to build high-quality servers, command-line applications, graphical native desktop user interfaces, among other classes of applications. Today, only command-line interfaces have support beyond the proof-of-concept stage; the other use cases will mature over time.

Like Lua, Roc's automatic memory management doesn't require a virtual machine, and it's possible to call Roc functions directly from any language that can call C functions. This makes Roc additionally useful as a language for implementing plugins, and gives you a way to incrementally transition a legacy code base from another language to Roc.

Unison is a modern, statically-typed purely functional language with the ability to describe entire distributed systems using a single program.
* No more writing encoders and decoders at every network boundary. Say where you want computations to run and it happens 🔮 — Dependencies are deployed on the fly.
* Your codebase is always live and typechecks, even in the middle of a refactoring. Unison has structured refactoring sessions, not a big misleading list of type errors.
* No more writing translation code between your values and the storage layer. Directly store values and unpersist them later without fear of dependency conflicts or version mismatches.
* Other tools try to recover structure from text; Unison stores code in a database. This eliminates builds, provides for instant nonbreaking renames, type-based search, and lots more.
* Many dependency conflicts arise from definitions competing for the same names. Since Unison references code by hash instead of by name, an entire class of conflicts can be eliminated.
